1. Tell me about a time when you challenged the status quo.


Situation : Sample app deprecation (What was the status quo)
Behavior : Backup decisions with data 
Impact: 4 of the 6 deprecated and ops load reduced -- smooth team transition 


2. Time when you had a conflict with someone.
With my manager + few members of the team regarding Sprint process. 




3. Time when you couldnâ€™t deliver the work you promised.





4. Time when you gave users the higher priority.
Situation : RLCamp was getting delayed, we had 2 customers who we had engaged on PoC level understanding
B: Built a reference application, wrote a blogpost and unblocked the customer 
I: Earned customer trust, customers are now willing to use the reference for much longer (until we build the right features)


5. Time when you saw two different tasks and how did you combine them?




6. Time when promised something and delivered.
Ads org -- Video playback on the home screen




7. Time when you exceeded expectations. 
S: Copy and port c code to android for TPH
B: Redesign the client from ground up and make is scalable
I: Maintainable code that was in active use until the backend was deprecated (5+ years later ) 


8.  How to stay up to date with technology? 
Have a craftsman mentality -- keep looking out for technology that will make your day-to-day craft easier.
E.g CDK vs Cloudformation yaml -- first teams to on-board
BONES Native AWS pipeline : First teams within robomaker to go full CD

RLCamp is a good example. CDK is another good example. For latest 


1.  Time when you have to choose between multiple things to work on. Which one did you choose and why?



2.  Time when you took risks and failed?
Image builder as a service: 
S: We noticed a lot of customers not using robomaker because on-boarding actual robots was hard -- decided to try and build an image that they can flash onto an SD card
B: Built a prototype that would collect user input on what they wanted (embedded with systems manager like credentials). 
On boot the robot would auto connect to a network & run "setup" that provisioned it 
F: Misunderstood the robotics OEM business (product learning). OEMs want to have tight control over goes on the initial image on the robot. 
Then the issue with coming pre-packaged with ROS (required ubuntu and info sec was queasy) -- are we distributing ubuntu ? etc

1.  Time when you had to teach your colleague. (Hire & Develop the best)
S: We working on a fairly ambigous problem (harvesting a schema etc). The team was stuck for 3 sprints trying to go beyond PoC
B: Stepped in and wrote 3 pesudo blogposts from a customers perspective on how to use this imaginary feature. Forced the team to think about how to find answers that will make us confident 
I: Team unblocked, design reviews progressing at good pace and we are now in iterative execution.
